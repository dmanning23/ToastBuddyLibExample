ToastBuddyLibExample
====================

An exmaple program to show how the ToastBuddyLib works

Currently tested to work on Windows and Ouya.  Other platforms supported by XNA and MonoGame would be easy to implement.

Note: This lib uses a couple of submodules, so make sure to run "git submodule init; git submodule update" after cloning.
